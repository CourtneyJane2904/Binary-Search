# Binary-Search

Just an implementation of recursive binary search that works on strings of integers and words
Determines the desired vector type by looking at the first char of the first element of the passed in vector.

Definitely not elegant but it wasn't meant to be- I more just wanted to implement this as part of Algorithms, DS and Computability.
